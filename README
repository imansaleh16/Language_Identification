Installation: 
=============
bash install.sh

Compiles maven projects lang_id and mallet.

Quick usage: 
============
After installation, extract files lang_id/data.tar.gz, lang_id/model_data.tar.gz and lang_id/liblinear-2.21/docsMR.txt.svm.model.tar.gz.
Test documents: test_doc written in Arabic and test_doc_2 written in German.

bash naive.sh test_doc
bash svm.sh test_doc
bash llda.sh test_doc

Dataset:
========
For all language identification techniques used in this program, the dataset used for training and testing is lang_id/data/docsMR.txt (training set, 5000 documents) and lang_id/data/docsME.txt (testing set, 1000 documents) and their gold labels lang_id/data/docsMR.labels and lang_id/data/docsME.labels. Data is obtained from [1] and contains 44 languages.

All models mentioned below were trained using lowercased 4 character grams to be able to train it on a variety of languages without using language specific tools or resources. Scripts for training and testing print macro and micro F1, in addition to recall, precision, F1 for each language.

To identify the language of a document, please place the document in the current folder. Two test documents are already placed in the folder: test_doc and test_doc_2.

Evaluation results for each of the three models are reported in Results_Naive.csv, Results_SVM.csv, Results_LLDA.csv.

Naive Bayes language identifier:
================================
1. Identify language of document:
bash naive.sh test_doc

2. Train and test:
bash train_test_naive.sh


SVM language identifier:
========================
1. Identify language of document:
bash svm.sh test_doc

2. Train and test: 
bash train_test_svm.sh

Trains a liblinear [2] SVM classifier using default parameters.


Labeled LDA language identifier:
================================

1. Identify language of document:
bash llda.sh test_doc

2. Train and test:
bash train_test_llda.sh

Trains labeled LDA technique [3], a variation of LDA topic modeling technique where topics are known a priori and correspond to user tags. In the case of language identification, languages are considered tags.
